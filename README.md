## Introduction

This is a repository with resources and credible studies on nutrition, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, slightly biased on the reporting of high fat, low carb dieting (but any study is accepted on PRs as long as it is truthful).

The criteria by which studies get mentioned is the usual criteria for rating academic papers:

1. published by reputable journals
2. credible, with no outstanding critiques (conspiracy theories on this and that industry not allowed as arguments)
3. mentioned by others

PRs welcome ;-)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do low fat diets lower the risk for heart disease?

No, at the moment there's evidence suggesting that by adopting a Low Fat diet there's no significant benefit in terms of heart health!

The [Women's Health Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Health_Initiative) conducted a study called "*Low-fat dietary pattern and cardiovascular disease* and here are the findings: [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515068](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28515068)

This study was a [randomized control trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) done on almost 50,000 women aged 50-79 years for a duration of 8 years, being one of the biggest and most costly dietary studies ever made. It's notable because versus weaker, more biased [observational studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_study), this kind of study cannot be easily ignored due to its scale and the methodology being used.

What it shows is that addopting low carb diets does not lower the risk of heart disease. E.g. no difference in heart attacks, no difference in strokes, no difference in deaths, no matter how you break it down.

### Are obese children destined to become obese adults?

There is a high probability, yes.

[Predicting Obesity in Young Adulthood from Childhood and Parental Obesity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709253371301) by Robert C. Whitaker et all, has the conclusions:

> Obese children under three years of age without obese parents are at low risk for obesity in adulthood, but among older children, obesity is an increasingly important predictor of adult obesity, regardless of whether the parents are obese. Parental obesity more than doubles the risk of adult obesity among both obese and nonobese children under 10 years of age.

Another study would be: [The predictive value of childhood body mass index values for overweight at age 35 y](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/59/4/810/4715794) by Guo SS, Roche AF, Chumlea WC, Gardner JD, Siervogel RM.

This article is behind a pay wall unfortunately, but it shows that obese children grow up to be obese adults.

### Does obesity happens as a result of the environment?

Environment plays a smaller part than many people think. At the moment there's evidence to suggest that 70% of the inclination for obesity is inherited, while only about 30% are things we can control.

See [An Adoption Study of Human Obesity](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198601233140401) by Albert J. Stunkard, M.D., Thorkild I.A. Sørensen, Dr.med., Craig Hanis, Ph.D., Thomas W. Teasdale, M.A., Ranajit Chakraborty, Ph.D., William J. Schull, Ph.D., and Fini Schulsinger:

> We examined the contributions of genetic factors and the family environment to human fatness in a sample of 540 adult Danish adoptees who were selected from a population of 3580 and divided into four weight classes: thin, median weight, overweight, and obese. **There was a strong relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their biologic parents** — for the mothers, P<0.0001; for the fathers, P<0.02. **There was no relation between the weight class of the adoptees and the body-mass index of their adoptive parents**. Cumulative distributions of the body-mass index of parents showed similar results; there was a strong relation between the body-mass index of biologic parents and adoptee weight class and no relation between the index of adoptive parents and adoptee weight class. Furthermore, the relation between biologic parents and adoptees was not confined to the obesity weight class, but was present across the whole range of body fatness — from very thin to very fat. **We conclude that genetic influences have an important role in determining human fatness in adults, whereas the family environment alone has no apparent effect**. (N Engl J Med 1986; 314:193–8.)

In other words, children were given for adoption and the environment of the adoptive family had no effect on their body mass, whereas the body-mass of their biological parents does have an effect.

Another similar study would be: [The Body-Mass Index of Twins Who Have Been Reared Apart](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199005243222102) by Albert J. Stunkard, M.D., Jennifer R. Harris, Ph.D., Nancy L. Pedersen, Ph.D., and Gerald E. McClearn, Ph.D.

This one studied samples of identical and fraternal twins, reared apart or reared together, with these conclusions:

> We conclude that genetic influences on body-mass index are substantial, whereas the childhood environment has little or no influence. These findings corroborate and extend the results of earlier studies of twins and adoptees. (N Engl J Med 1990; 322:1483–7.)

### Is obesity a predisposition by the inherited genes?

Not really. Yes, we answered the question of "*does obesity happens as a result of the environment?*", by observing that children are very predisposed to obesity via their biological parents.

But if that's the case, then this is in fact a blow to the "*calories in, calories out*" fad, for this very simple reason:

1. [Trends in intake of energy and macronutrients--United States, 1971-2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14762332) says that "*during 1971-2000, the prevalence of obesity in the United States increased from 14.5% to 30.9%.*"
2. [Obesity, Abdominal Obesity, Physical Activity, and Caloric Intake in US Adults: 1988 to 2010](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(14)00191-0/abstract) says that "*average body mass index (BMI) increased by 0.37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.44) per year in both women and men.*"

Genes cannot evolve in mere decades, like between 1970 and 2010. It's not the environment, so something else is making parents give birth children predisposed to obesity.
